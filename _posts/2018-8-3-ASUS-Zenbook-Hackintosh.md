title: ASUS Zenbook Hackintosh
---

After one year, I finally managed to install macOS on my Asus Zenbook UX410. It was a difficult and time-consuming process. Everything works fine now, just like a real MacBook Pro. I decided to share what I have achieved and create a guide that works for all Asus Zenbook.

You can find my guide on tonymacx86: [[Guide] Asus Zenbook using Clover UEFI hotpatch](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-asus-zenbook-using-clover-uefi-hotpatch.257448/).

I host all the files on GitHub [here](https://github.com/hieplpvip/ASUS-ZENBOOK-HACKINTOSH).

Currently it only supports 3 models: UX410 on KabyLake, UX430 on KabyLake and UX430 on KabyLake-R. However, adding support for other laptops is easy. Just send me your full specs and original ACPI files dumped from Clover.
